## Task Automation


Starting at the beginning of our day, routines begin to take over.  For many of us, a routine begins with turning off alarms, stumbling towards a cup of coffee, and pouring ourselves into our morning hygiene routine.


Once finished with our morning rituals, we mosey to our vehicles and manage our way to work.  Every step before heading to work could be considered a process.  This process, consisting of a workflow, or a series of steps that need to be completed in a process, has a handful of tasks that may vary from person to person. 


Upon arriving at work, the rest of your day could be described as an end-to-end process.  This process could be broken down from hour to hour, pre or post lunch, or however convenient.  One thing that is certain, though, is that work consists of many tasks.  


Our morning process may not have many shortcuts, unlike our work processes.  Breakfast can be shortened by mixing your oatmeal with coffee instead of milk, or by combining your shampoos with your conditioners, but there are not many more options!  Work, on the other hand, can have many more tasks that can be simplified by way of automation.


## Advantages of Task Automation


Automation of certain tasks has a handful of advantages.  To start with, automation of routine, mind-numbing tasks can increase job satisfaction for many employees.  Taking drudgery out of work makes people feel more energetic, efficient, and engaged.  The sort of agility gained by automation allows employees to get more involved with their teammates and pursue more creative, rewarding tasks for themselves and their company.


Task automation can accomplish many things.  In the realm of data entry, automation can perform tasks inside spreadsheets through both Google and Microsoft, shared drives like Google Drive and Microsoft’s OneDrive and SharePoint, pdfs by way of Adobe, emails, word processors, databases, and practically any web-based activity.  In the exact same scenarios for entry, automation can extract data as well.


Furthermore, automation can process data.  It can assist in data validation, cleaning, manipulating, and storage.  Need a number of files downloaded, renamed, and moved?  It can be done seamlessly.  Need data harvested from those downloaded files and compiled into a csv?  Automation has you there, too. 


Essentially, if it is a part of work that is done routinely, automation can help.  In the sphere of data entry, data extraction, and data processing, automation can work side-by-side with you in a non-invasive way, increasing both work and customer satisfaction by allaying the mundane, reducing errors, and speeding up entire processes from the beginning to the end.


## Assisting In Task Automation


Assisting in getting your tasks automated is an easy task.  The first step is to identify your routines.  These routines can be tasks that are as simple as logging onto a website, navigating to a particular webpage, and harvesting data.  These routines can also be a sequence of tasks as well.  An example of this might be getting data from a webpage, adding it to excel, transforming and manipulating data, saving the file, and then emailing it to the appropriate person.


Once an identification of a task has occurred, the next step is documentation.  At this stage, you can take notes on each step made to complete the task.  Usually, a quick audit is all that is necessary!  From here, reaching out to Jack Newton and Seth Mikkelsen with your ideas and your note of steps will begin the process.


## What Does the Process Look Like?


Once you have reached out, several actions will be triggered.  An investigation into the input types, process and application stability, benefits, process complexity, and input data will occur.  The results of this investigation will determine priority.  


After priority is determined and the decision is made to proceed, a deeper look into the tasks will begin.  This will likely involve emails, calls, meetings and interviews, and task monitoring.  Task monitoring can either be in person or done by screen recording the task.
